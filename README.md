### Hi there 👋

- 👩🏻 I am Meng-Ju (Trinity) Chiu, an MS Computer Science student at the University of Southern California, following my BS in Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Central University. My focus includes Web Development, Data Analysis, Data Science, and Product Management.

  As a former Product Owner at Mobile Drive, I led cross-functional teams to develop Unity applications for Head-Up Display and Dynamic Road View, using Agile methodologies to streamline workflows and collaborate with partners like Stellantis Co. This role enhanced my project management, team coordination, and product delivery skills.

  My technical expertise includes C++, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and MongoDB, with experience in full-stack web development and data analysis. Proficient in project management tools like Jira and familiar with Agile and Scrum methodologies, I effectively manage timelines, resources, and stakeholder expectations.
